##Sample Coding Interview Questions
######(aka Practice Makes Perfect)

###The Premise

1. Getting a job in software engineering usually requires a demonstration
   of one's analytical prowess.
2. During an on-site interview, said prowess is often measured using a
   coding interview.
3. Virtually no one except those who are actively seeking new employment
   spends time practicing interview questions.
4. Practice makes <strike>you gooder</strike> perfect.
5. Being good at things is good.
6. I am both seeking new employment AND desirous of being good at things.
7. I should practice doing coding interview questions.

#### So...what's in this repo, anyway?

This repo includes a series of sample coding interview questions and my
honest answers to them. *Yes, even if I botched the answer.* My answers may
be wrong, or they may have bugs or other logical flaws. 
Being right isn't the point -- *showing a thought process is!* 

I've found these questions freely on the web and included attributions 
given wherever possible. If you're the author and object to having me post
your question here, please let me know.

The answer to each question was written in an interview-like setting:
half-hour time limit, with the thought process spelled out as completely as
possible. I drafted my answers on paper, simulating a whiteboard, and then
later transcribed them into markdown. Code was generally written and tested
later to see how close to the answer I came. Some answers may have later
revisions to correct bugs and reflect additional thought.
